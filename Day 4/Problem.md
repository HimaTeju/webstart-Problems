# E-Commerce Website

## Objective:
Build a multi-page e-commerce website with a focus on consistent design, interactive UI elements, and basic user interactions.

## What to Do:

1. **Create a Multi-Page Website**  
   - Develop an e-commerce website that includes the following pages:
     - **Homepage**: A welcoming page that introduces the brand, displays promotional content, and provides a gateway to other parts of the site.
     - **Product Listing Page**: A page that showcases various products, organized in a grid or list, with images, names, prices, and brief descriptions.
     - **Product Details Page**: A detailed view of a selected product, including images, a comprehensive description, pricing, and an "Add to Cart" button.

2. **Submit Your Website**  
   - Ensure that your website meets the following requirements:
     - **UI Design**: Create a user interface that is clean, intuitive, and visually appealing, similar to popular e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Flipkart.
     - **Unique Style**: Brownie points for designing a UI that is distinct from Amazon, Flipkart, or other popular platforms, showcasing your creativity and design skills.
     - **Consistent Design**: Use a uniform layout, color scheme, and typography across all pages for a cohesive user experience.

3. **Styling**  
   - Apply CSS styling to your website to enhance its visual appeal and usability.
     - **Header and Footer**: Use consistent styling for the header and footer on all pages, with clear branding and essential information.
     - **Product Listing**: Style the product grid or list with spacing, borders, and hover effects to improve readability and user interaction.
     - **Product Details**: Focus on a clean and detailed layout that highlights the productâ€™s features, with clear call-to-action buttons.

4. **Optional Challenge: Create a Login Page**  
   - Implement a simple login form as a separate page:
     - **Login Form**: Create a form with fields for email/username and password, and a "Login" button.
     - **Basic Validation**: Use JavaScript to ensure both fields are filled before submission.
     - **Styling**: Apply CSS to style the form, with hover effects on input fields and buttons.
     - **Optional Enhancements**: Include a "Forgot Password" link, a "Remember Me" checkbox, and display an error message if the form is submitted with empty fields.
