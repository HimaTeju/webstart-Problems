# Simple FAQ Page

## What to Do:

1. **Create a Basic FAQ Page**  
   - Develop a simple HTML webpage that functions as an FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page.

2. **Submit Your FAQ Page**  
   - Ensure that your HTML page meets the following requirements:
     - **FAQ Structure**: Include at least three FAQ items. Each item should consist of a question and a corresponding answer.
     - **Toggle Functionality**: Implement JavaScript to toggle the visibility of the answer when the question is clicked.
     - **Arrow Indicators**: Include arrow icons that change direction based on whether the answer is shown or hidden.

3. **Styling**  
   - Apply basic CSS styling to your FAQ page to make it user-friendly and visually appealing.
     - **FAQ Items**: Style the questions to make them prominent and clickable, with padding and borders.
     - **Answer Display**: Ensure the answers are initially hidden and styled to appear clearly when shown.
     - **Arrow Indicators**: Style the arrow icons to enhance user interaction, using hover effects or color changes.
     - **Container Layout**: Arrange the FAQ items in a neat, organized manner with proper spacing and alignment.

4. **Optional Challenge: Animated Toggle Effect**  
   - If you are feeling confident and want to take on a challenge, enhance your FAQ page with a smooth animated toggle effect.
     - **Animation Design**:
       - Implement a sliding or fading effect when answers are shown or hidden.
       - Ensure the arrow icon rotates smoothly to indicate the toggle state.
       - **Styling**: Refine the FAQ page with more advanced CSS techniques, like transitions or keyframes, to create a polished look and feel.
