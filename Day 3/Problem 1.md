# Simple Calculator

## What to Do:

1. **Create a Basic Calculator Page**  
   - Develop a simple HTML webpage that functions as a basic calculator.

2. **Submit Your Calculator Page**  
   - Ensure that your HTML page meets the following requirements:
     - **Input Fields**: Include two text boxes where users can enter numbers.
     - **Operation Buttons**: Provide buttons for basic arithmetic operations: Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide.
     - **Result Display**: Show the result of the calculation in a dedicated area below the buttons.

3. **Styling**  
   - Apply basic CSS styling to your calculator page to make it user-friendly and visually appealing.
     - **Input Fields**: Style the text boxes with padding and borders.
     - **Buttons**: Design the operation buttons with consistent sizing, colors, and hover effects.
     - **Result Display**: Ensure the result is clearly visible, using larger font size or contrasting colors.
     - **Container Layout**: Arrange the input fields, buttons, and result display in a neat, organized manner with proper spacing and alignment.

4. **Optional Challenge: Calculator UI with Numbers and Symbols**  
   - If you are feeling confident and want to take on a challenge, enhance your calculator with a more traditional calculator-style UI.
     - **Calculator Design**:
       - Create a grid layout with buttons for numbers 0-9 and arithmetic symbols (+, -, *, /, =).
       - Allow users to input numbers and operations by clicking the buttons instead of typing.
       - Display the calculation process in real-time, updating the result as operations are performed.
       - **Styling**: Make the calculator resemble a real calculator, with buttons styled to look like keys and the display area resembling a digital screen.
