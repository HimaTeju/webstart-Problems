# My YouTube

## What to Do:

1. **Create an HTML Page**  - Develop a basic HTML webpage that displays a list of your favourite video thumbnails with titles, similar to a YouTube layout.

2. **Submit Your Basic Page** - Ensure that your HTML page meets the following requirements:
   - **Header**: Displays "My YouTube."
   - **Main Content**: Shows video thumbnails, each with a title, description, channel name, views, and likes, along with a link to a YouTube video.
   - **Footer**: Displays "© 2024 YouTube Style Webpage."

3. **Optional Challenge: Implement Search Functionality** -  If you are feeling confident and want to take on a challenge, integrate a search form into your page.
   - The search form should:
     - Include a text input for entering the search term.
     - Include a submit button that redirects to YouTube search results with the user's input as the query.

**Hint**: Use the YouTube search URL format `https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=` and append the user’s input as the query parameter.
