# Mini Periodic Table

## What to Do:

1. **Create an HTML Page** - Develop a basic HTML webpage that displays a simple periodic table layout featuring the first 20 elements.

2. **Submit Your Basic Page** - Ensure that your HTML page meets the following requirements:
   - **Header:** Displays "Simple/Mini Periodic Table."
   - **Main Content:** Shows a table representing the first 20 elements, arranged in their correct positions within the periodic table.
     - **Element Blocks:** Each element block should display the element symbol and atomic number.
     - **Table Layout:** The layout should accurately reflect the first 20 elements, with proper spacing and alignment.
   - **Footer:** Displays "© 2024 Simple Periodic Table."

3. **Optional Challenge: Expand the Table** - If you’re up for a challenge, include more elements beyond the first 20 in your periodic table.
   - **Extended Elements:** Add as many elements as you like, continuing to maintain the correct structure and layout of the periodic table.

**Hint:** You can use HTML attributes like `colspan` and `rowspan` to ensure the elements are placed correctly within the table.
