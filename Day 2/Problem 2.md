# Restaurant Menu

## What to Do:

1. **Create a Simple Menu Page**  
   - Develop a basic HTML webpage that displays a restaurant-style menu.

2. **Submit Your Basic Page**  
   - Ensure that your HTML page meets the following requirements:
     - **Header**: Displays the name of the restaurant.
     - **Main Content**: Shows a list of menu items categorized into sections (e.g., Starteres, Main Courses, Desserts). Each item should include a name and price.
     - **Footer**: Include a simple footer with text like "Â© 2024 [Restaurant Name] Menu."

3. **Styling**  
   - Apply basic CSS styling to your page to enhance its appearance.
     - **Header**: Use a distinct font size and color to make the restaurant name stand out.
     - **Menu Sections**: Add borders or background colors to separate each section.
     - **Menu Items**: Style the item names and prices with different fonts or colors, and add padding to space them out.
     - **Footer**: Center the footer text and use a subtle color to differentiate it from the main content.

4. **Optional Challenge: Use Advanced Styling**  
   - If you are feeling confident and want to take on a challenge, enhance your menu with more advanced CSS styling techniques.
     - Examples include:
       - **Hover Effects**: Add hover effects to menu items to highlight them when the user hovers over them.
       - **CSS Grid or Flexbox**: Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to create a more responsive and organized layout.
       - **Font Awesome Icons**: Incorporate icons next to menu items to represent food categories (e.g., a leaf for vegetarian dishes).
