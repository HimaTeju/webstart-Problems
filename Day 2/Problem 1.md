## What to Do:

1. **Create a Personal Introduction Page**  
   - Develop a basic HTML webpage that serves as an introduction for yourself.

2. **Submit Your Basic Page**  
   - Ensure that your HTML page meets the following requirements:
     - **Header**: Displays your name.
     - **Main Content**: Shows a profile picture, education details, and a list of interests.
     - **Footer**: Include a simple footer with text like "Â© 2024 [Person's Name] Profile."

3. **Styling**  
   - Apply basic CSS styling to your page to make it visually appealing.
     - **Profile Picture**: Style the picture with a circular border and a shadow effect.
     - **Text Styling**: Use different font sizes and colors to differentiate between the person's name, education, and interests.
     - **Content Container**: Add padding, margins, and background color to the container for a cleaner layout.
     - **Footer**: Center the footer text and use a lighter font color.

4. **Optional Challenge: Use Advanced Styling**  
   - If you are feeling confident and want to take on a challenge, enhance your introduction page with more advanced CSS styling techniques.
     - Examples include:
       - **Animations**: Add subtle animations, such as a fade-in effect for the profile picture or a smooth transition for hover effects on text.
       - **Responsive Design**: Implement media queries to ensure the page looks good on various screen sizes.
       - **Custom Fonts**: Use Google Fonts or other font services to incorporate unique typography.
